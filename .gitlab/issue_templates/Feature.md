<!-- The first three sections: "Problem to solve", "Intended users" and "Proposal", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. -->

### Problem to solve

<!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, "As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value)." -->

### Intended users

<!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write "Unknown" and fill this field in later. -->

### Further details

<!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. -->

### Proposal

<!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! -->

### Permissions and Security

<!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?-->

### Documentation


### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

<!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. -->
